# OOP for Software Engineers
## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts - Cricket Game Example in C++

![OOP Session](https://img.shields.io/badge/Session-OOP%20Concepts-blue)

Welcome to the repository for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) session, where we use a console-based Cricket game written in C++ to explore and teach the core principles of OOP.

## üìú Session Overview

In this session, we discuss and demonstrate the following key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming:

1. **Encapsulation**: How data is bundled and kept safe using access modifiers in C++.
2. **Inheritance**: Reusing and extending code functionality for different game elements.
3. **Polymorphism**: Implementing runtime behavior using virtual functions for player actions.
4. **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex operations in the Cricket game using abstract base classes.

### Highlights:
- A practical approach using a **console-based Cricket game**.
- Clear demonstrations of how OOP principles apply to real-world scenarios.
- Tips on writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

## üèè About the Cricket Game

The Cricket game is a command-line application designed to simulate a cricket match. It uses classes like `Team`, `Player`, and `Game` to showcase OOP in action. By working through this game, you'll understand how to apply OOP concepts to a project step-by-step.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `Game.cpp`: Contains the main logic for the Cricket game.
- `Team.h` and `Player.h`: Class definitions for teams and players.
- Example scenarios demonstrating the use of OOP principles.
